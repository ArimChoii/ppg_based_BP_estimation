# Assessment of non-invasive blood pressure prediction from PPG and rPPG signals using deep learning

## Introduction
The code contained in this repository is intended to reproduce the results of the paper "Assessment of non-invasive blood pressure prediction from PPG and rPPG signals using deep learning" [Link to Paper](). Contained herein are scripts for downloading data from the MIMC-II database, data preprocessing as well as  training neural networks for (r)PPG based blood pressure prediction.

Trainings are performed using Tensorflow 2.4.1 and Python 3.9. The scripts can be called from the command line. 

## Installation
This repository uses a python virtual environment which can be created using the command
```
python3 -m venv venv/
```
The virtual environment can be activated using the command
```angular2html
source venv/bin/activate
```
Necessary python packages can be installed using the command
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Using the scripts
### Downloading data from the MIMIC-III database
the script `download_mimic_iii_records.py` can be used to download the records used for PPG based training. The specific record names are provided in the file `MIMIC-III_ppg_dataset_records.txt`. The script can be called from the command line using the command
```
python3 download_mimic_iii_records.py [-h] input output

positional arguments:
  input       File containing the names of the records downloaded from the MIMIC-III DB
  output      Folder for storing downloaded MIMIC-III records
```
